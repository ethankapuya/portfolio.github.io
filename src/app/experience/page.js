                    A 4-week full-time collaborative programming experience with a data science assignment in a startup environment.
                    I helped develop Bearing AI's port-to-port nautical distance calculation service in Python designed
                    to pass criteria such as compatibility to use-case, accuracy, and configurability, now in use in
                    Bearing AI's maritime ML platforms. Assisted in comparing various external API distances to a pipeline of
                    benchmark distance datasets based on customer data, and integrated these APIs to
                    the maritime ML platforms for a more accurate and complete port-to-port distance service.
